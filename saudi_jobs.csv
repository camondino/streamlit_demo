Our Total Rewards team is focused on designing and providing compensation and benefits programs that address the financial, mental, and physical well-being of Zapiens and their families. Zapier is growing and the Total Rewards Operations Analyst will be instrumental in supporting this growth through partnering with the Rewards Teams and our People team in providing compensation expertise in the day-to-day operations and the design and implementation of Rewards programs.

About You

You have 2 years or more experience, and you consider yourself a Rewards whiz and are looking to expand your experience. Your experience should include some time working in Compensation, and exposure to benefits would be a plus.
You have a love and hate relationship with analytics, reporting, and surveys - you love the data that drives decision-making but understand the hard work that goes into survey participation and market research. You’re up for the challenging of wrangling data and turning it into actionable information.
You LOVE Excel or Google Sheets and you’re a wizard at manipulating data and turning it into digestible charts that tell the story behind the data. Creating multiple-row formulas excite you and you’ve been known to get an eye-roll when you get excited about learning a new data trick
You have a strong attention to detail that you noticed the out of place period at the end of the sentence in the 3rd bullet above! The analytics and research you’ll provide will be integral to delivering best-in-class programs so it’s important you carry about the small and big details.
Do you often have multiple tabs opened on your web browser? Some would say that’s hectic, but we call it organized chaos! Either way, you are great at time management, prioritizing work and keeping track of things.
Team work makes the dream work is not just a saying; you are able to effectively collaborate in a team, and communicate your ideas and recommendations in a clear, compelling, and engaging way, both verbal and written.
Things You’ll Do

It takes a lot to keep the Rewards team functioning smoothly! You’ll be the primary owner of Total Rewards tools, applications, and content (CAT, Payfactors, Pave, Trinet, Glide, Bamboo, etc.) including reporting and analysis (e.g. ongoing employee analytics [pay equity review], benefits program utilization, equity cap table reporting, and working with the different Rewards functions to keep process documentation updated).
Partner with other People and Ops departments to deliver on programatic processes like providing salary ranges to Talent Acquisition or providing bonus proration reports to Payroll.
One of our Rewards Guiding principles is data-driven decision making. You’ll play a critical role in ensuring we lean into this principle by leading market research and trend analysis. This will include rewards survey participation and identifying new surveys and trend reports.
Project member or lead across Total Rewards projects where aligned to role; som key annual projects you’ll engage in are:
Project Lead - Annual Market Review and Analysis
Analysis of market changes and make recommendations for changes; present findings to Compensation Team + Head of Total Rewards for approval and sign-off
Implement changes (e.g. updates to salary ranges, headcount planning, and recruiter tools)
Communication and training
Project Member - Annual Salary Review (Pave system and ASR training)
Will drive systems enhancements and systems training
Will drive updates to ASR process communication and training materials

"Senior Manager, Campaign Organizing (Movement Building)",Wikimedia Foundation,27378,3165464345,, EMEA ,Remote,16-07-22,,Full-time,· Mid-Senior level,"501-1,000  · internet",Publishing,Actively recruiting,,"Summary




The Wikimedia Foundation is the non-profit organization that operates Wikipedia – one of the most popular websites in the world, accessed by over 1.8 billion unique devices every month. It is the only non-profit in the top 50 websites, supported by a community of millions of individual donors around the world.




The Wikimedia Foundation is looking for an internationally experienced organizing and outreach manager to lead a recently established team focused on growing a vibrant, global ecosystem of Wikimedia content campaigns. Reporting to the Director of Community Programs in the Advancement department, this role is a special opportunity to apply experience and practices from other movements and digital campaigning contexts to Wikipedia’s unique, trusted process of public knowledge creation — to help the Wikimedia movement achieve its 2030 vision of becoming “the essential infrastructure of the ecosystem of free knowledge.”




Community-led content campaigns — like Wiki Loves Monuments, Art + Feminism, Women in Red, Months of African Cinema, or Wikipedia Asian Month — are the Wikimedia movement’s most successful tactic for organized content creation and bridging knowledge gaps on Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, Wikidata, and other projects. Increasingly, Wikimedia content campaigns provide accessible entry points for new contributors and partners motivated to spread reliable knowledge on high-impact topic areas (e.g. human rights, gender, climate and sustainability), and so have been identified as a key investment area for movement growth. The three-person Campaign Organizing program was set up in 2021 to shape and coordinate org-wide investment in tools, support systems, partnerships, and audience development strategies to grow the scale and impact of community content campaigns.




You are responsible for:




Collaborating across the Foundation, and with movement allies and partners, to create shared systems and frameworks for Wikimedia content campaigns:




Working with the Campaigns Product Team and other product and technology partners on the design and implementation of action-focused software to support campaign and event organizers.
Working with the Partnerships team to develop relationships and design joint activities with organizations that can help the Wikimedia movement access new contributors and audiences through campaigns (e.g. the African Union, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Health Organization, or UN Human Rights).
Designing global campaigns like #WikiForHumanRights and helping connect Foundation capacities — such as partnerships, communications, research, grantmaking, advocacy, and capacity building — to “topics for impact” prioritized by the Wikimedia movement.
Learning from and partnering with Wikimedia Affiliates to increase the impact, visibility and sustainability of content campaigns.
Working with Foundation data experts and community stakeholders to shape metrics and evaluation that help us understand the impact of campaigns on readers, contributors, and content.




Developing the Campaign Organizing team and operationalizing community support systems:




Overseeing the design of training and capacity building for organizers with a wide variety of experiences and motivations, helping them to independently run content campaigns in the Wikimedia movement.
Providing targeted program design and implementation support to key movement partners using campaign tactics.
Providing inclusive mentorship and advisory support to organizers and grantees, helping them to apply campaign best practices in context.
Developing documentation and resources, and working with other community-facing teams to provide peer learning spaces for campaign organizers to exchange knowledge and spark collaboration.
Serving as part of the Community Programs leadership team — collaborating closely with the Director and peer program leads (Education, Culture & Heritage) to foster team culture, systems and strategy, develop cross-program collaborations, design shared evaluation frameworks, and set annual goals and budgets.




Skills and experience:




7+ years of experience building teams and managing collaborations focused on community organizing and digital campaigning for political, activist, or other social causes.
A strong professional network in digital organizing or activism in global and multilingual contexts.
Experience using digital technologies to expand the impact of social movements by training organizers, designing calls to action, or disseminating support to communities of practice.
Experience with equitable and culturally inclusive approaches to organizing, especially in sensitive topic areas like the environmental movement, human rights, gender equality, or working with linguistic or ethnic minority communities.
Experience working with organizers in the global majority, e.g. Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa, or Asia.
Outstanding verbal and written communication skills with the ability to craft accessible and engaging messages for internal and external stakeholders.
Experience using data- and evidence-based approaches to design programs, services, and evaluation.
Strong written and spoken English, and experience communicating to an international multilingual audience. Non-native English speakers are welcomed.

Qualities that are important to us:




A passion for and belief in free and open knowledge, and a willingness to get involved in the complex, decentralized process of creating it.
Commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion — respect for and acceptance of multiple cultures and customs, and a curiosity about the world.
Commitment to learning and development, and a passion for providing engaged coaching and mentorship for your team.
Collaborative mindset and a proactive, empathetic approach to working cross-functionally in a complex organization.




Additionally, we’d love it if you have:




Fluency or proficiency in a language other than English.
Experience working with and/or managing remote teams: our team is already spread across South America, West Africa, and Southeast Asia, and we expect to continue building a team that reflects the global nature of our community.
Experience as a Wikimedia contributor, or with using Wikimedia projects as part of your career.
Experience providing support for other decentralized online or volunteer communities.




About the Wikimedia Foundation

Our vision is a world in which every single human can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. We believe that everyone has the potential to contribute something to our shared knowledge, and that everyone should be able to access that knowledge freely.

Do you wish you could control which projects to work on and choose your own pay rate? Are you interested in the future of work and how the cloud will form teams? If so - the Gigster Talent Network is for you.




The Senior Frontend Developer position is a critical role in the teams we form for important US clients such as IBM, US Bank, Harley Davidson, Colgate, Dapper and 500 others. In this role, you will own the entire frontend experience - from technical leadership to UI/UX to integrating the latest technology with the backend components. The tech stack will vary with the projects - but range from Angular 2+, React, Vue, etc.




Gigster is looking for exceptional React Frontend Engineers who are passionate about application development and to join the Gigster Talent Network, and ship complex software products at scale for enterprise clients. You will get the opportunity to work with other Gigsters and our client(s) to build complex client-side applications that use the latest technologies. Your fellow freelance software engineers on the Talent Network range from founders and owners of their own software consultancies, to lead engineers from well-known technology companies.

Responsibilities

You need to be self-motivated and self-managing. You’ll most likely be given broadly defined goals that’ll require you to break them down into achievable steps and tasks. No one is going to sit around and assign your user stories.
You have to be able to unblock yourself technically if you get stuck OR be very communicative and navigate to the right people to help unblock you. If you’re scared to get on video calls this position probably isn’t for you.
You’ll basically be given access to the git repo and patted out the door to get the local environment up and running on your own. Again, this isn’t IBM. No one is going to hold your hand like a college CS freshman, this is the big leagues. Self-independence and accountability are held in very high regard.
The pace and tempo that the team moves at is very fast and very fluid. If you work well in a very structured and vanilla environment then this project is not for you.
We have morning standups where you’re expected to communicate what you’re doing and what your goals are. If you’d rather not do this and just submit jira tickets while hiding in the back, then this project is not for you.
The team looks for suggestions and opinions on how to do things better. We expect you, being the rockstar that you are, to provide advice and suggestions based on your past experience. We are a flat team and everyone’s opinion matters.
Design and build complex and performant web applications using the latest web tooling and modern JavaScript frameworks, including React.js & Redux and Node.js

Take ownership of project success by providing strategic technical guidance and direction, as needed

Senior Manager Client Solutions/Ops and Compliance,GoGlobal,35439060,3176651210,, EMEA ,Remote,22-07-22,200,Full-time,· Mid-Senior level,51-200  · human resources,Services,Actively recruiting,,"About us




GoGlobal is the world’s fastest growing, privately owned Global Employer of Record (EOR) service provider with a globally distributed and remote workforce.




GoGlobal’s technology-enabled EOR solution allows businesses of all sizes and geographies to hire staff globally without the need to set up a local entity, opening new doors to rapid expansion and growth. GoGlobal clients can hire top talent anywhere in the world – quickly, cost effectively and compliantly.




Why now




The pandemic has shown that people can be just as productive without a commute and that talent is global, not within close proximity to an office. We believe that this societal shift will continue indefinitely, and companies and potential candidates will need organizations like us to help them “GoGlobal.”




Why GoGlobal and how we’re different




We’re private: We totally respect that many companies raise a lot of capital and we applaud these successes. At GoGlobal, we simply like people actually in the business to control the business.
We’re not a rocket ship: We’re pretty happy on earth. Growth isn’t everything.
We’re not a tech company: We fundamentally believe that this industry cannot be replaced by tech in the foreseeable future and it’s the people that make the difference.
We’re profitable: We’re pretty prudent in how we spend money because we’re managing our business without outside investors. That said, we’re profitable and continue to grow sustainably. We sleep better at night knowing that we don’t have to raise money. Maybe it’s a little old school, but we believe businesses should be profitable to survive long term.
We’re diverse. No, really, we are. Compare the “Our People” page on our website to others you know. We think you’ll agree!
We’re transparent: Every month we openly share our strategy and financials so you feel ownership of your role in the company’s success.
We’re structured as a partnership versus a corporation: We’re the only EOR in the world that’s structured this way, allowing us to attract some of the best talent since everyone has the opportunity to be a partner in the firm.
We are the scrappy underdog: We think it’s more fun to be a pirate than to be in the navy.

If this appeals to you, continue reading for a more long text about working at Silverfin and your role ??




According to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if minority groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal.




What can we offer you?




Actual, proper work-life balance
A salary range of €75.000 - €110.000 a year
Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely
Personal growth training and opportunities
Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 35 colleagues in 15 different countries
A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues
A €1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills
We offer monthly company-wide Wellbeing Days for all employees (10 paid days off in 2022)




What will you work on?




Building and maintaining integrations with accountancy software packages and APIs.
Improving and expanding our on-premise Ruby client which runs on thousands of our customer’s systems.
Designing and building features to make the lives of our system administrators easier, such as an auto-updater and continuous deployment.




What are we looking for?




You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary.
You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls.
You enjoy integrating with APIs and aren’t easily dissuaded when encountering unreliable or poorly documented systems.
You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.
You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally.
You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.
You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.
You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.




What’s a Silverfin?




At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.




The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.




What’s Team Syncs?




One of the core features of Silverfin is integration with the bookkeeping software that accountants already work with, in order to import their accounting data. This means we have integrations with over 30 different vendors, and we want to add more as we expand to different markets.




Team Syncs is one of the teams responsible for creating and maintaining these kind of integrations. The ideal candidate loves working with APIs, including the uncertainty they bring. Some APIs we need to use are poorly designed, badly documented or unreliable, and it can be challenging to build a robust integration. Yet the satisfaction of empowering our customers to import gigabytes of data from their clunky bookkeeping software and to use Silverfin's advanced features makes it all worth it.




Being a tinkerer and having persistence to solve puzzles will definitely be a plus to face our many challenges due to the plethora of different systems we interact with.




What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?




We’re a remote-first engineering team of 35 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.




Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organised that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.




Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!




We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.




What does working at Silverfin look like?




We work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people. In team syncs, however, we almost have no front-end work to do, as most of of our work features do not involve a UI.




Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.




We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice. Team syncs also owns a Ruby client app that runs on windows servers to interface with local accounting software.




No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.




Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.




*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?




Requirements




You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming language.
You get Rails
Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)

More About Engineering At Omnipresent

The software engineering and product teams work very closely together to form empowered teams with shared KPIs, that include Subject Matter Experts from other departments in Omnipresent (when that makes sense). Each team decides how it works for itself, and teams have a mix of approaches that vary based on their preferences, the needs of their users and the specifics of the work they are doing. Engineers interact frequently with our internal customers, and occasionally with external ones, to understand what they need from the software, get their feedback on what is being built and work with them directly if something goes wrong.

We have maintained an emphasis on technical quality as we grow - ensuring that our software remains refactorable, and is refactored, as we build - so we can maintain a high pace of delivery over time. We have high levels of automated test coverage, a very fast release cycle, and consider refactoring part of the work. We are working on improving the availability of slack time in the team so we can deliver more “quick win” improvements to the product and technology.

Omnipresent is looking for an experienced software Quality Engineer who can help us continue building our customer and internal facing OmniPlatform at a high level of quality. This is not your typical software testing role - we are looking for someone who can help guide overall quality for the team. That means helping engineers deliver well tested software, building a system that allows us to release value quickly and easily, and have confidence that we are solving our customers problems.

The Role

In this role you will be working across a few small teams dedicated around a product or service offering. You will help enable the teams by bridging gaps, reducing dependencies, and facilitating knowledge in all aspects around quality and testing. You will be supported by other enablers that work across teams specialising in both code and data while working closely with our existing quality engineer. You will help us define and implement a system to ensure that Omnipresent is building and releasing high quality software while also growing our testing and quality capability within our engineering teams. This role touches all phases of development, from solution definition through to release and production. We are not hiring for your stereotypical tester role - we are looking for someone who is a system builder, collaborator, coach, and automation specialist that can help us release quality software quickly.

From One Day To The Next You May Be

Coaching product engineers on how to test the feature they’re working on
Improving our CI/CD pipeline & test frameworks
Talking to Product Management about the problems that need to be solved
Collaborating on broader process initiatives that could cover all aspects of engineering
This role carries a lot of autonomy and will be key to shaping the future of Omnipresent engineering. We are looking for someone with outstanding communication skills, coaching ability and the ability to think about the system of software development, and how to tweak it to make it better.

Check out our Stackshare to learn more about our technology stack: https://stackshare.io/omnipresent/omnipresent

You Might Be a Good Fit If

You have at least 5 years of software technology experience
You have worked in a quality/QA/SDET type role for at least 2 years in a web environment
You have experience with automated test frameworks and know what a good test might look like, at all the levels within a system
You can explain why exploratory testing is an important capability for a team to have
You are comfortable teaching others how to test without needing to be the designated tester yourself
You appreciate that software quality is influenced by a multitude of factors other than just how much testing occurs
You have a demonstrated ability to coach others, influence peers and gain buy-in for changes without authority

We Would Consider It a Bonus If you have worked in an environment following

Modern Testing principles, even better if you can explain how these principles relate to practical examples
You are familiar with fullstack Javascript applications and the testing ecosystem
You understand DevOps practices and the thinking behind them, and recognise the role that Quality plays in DevOps
You have worked with automated release tooling such as Circle CI, understand feature flags, ring based deployments, and other related technologies

Company retreats: We have an annual company-wide retreats, and well as socials and other team building activities.

Home office setup: It should go without saying that we will provide you with the equipment you need to work from home in the same way you would if you were in an office. Prefer a PC to a Mac? No problem. You choose what you need. We'll give you a budget to get all the infrastructure that enables you to work effectively wherever you are, including broadband costs.
Education budget: Your development should be a continuous conversation with your manager and they will support you in choosing what you need whether that's accreditations, workshops, or formal degree programs or courses. Important is that you update your Individual Development Plan with any kind of education you take, so that you make sure that you apply the knowledge you have gained in theory, and the learned information will stay with you long term.
